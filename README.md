Piano Precision
================

### A program that assists analyzing recorded piano performances together with their scores.

This program is adapted from [Sonic Visualiser] (https://github.com/sonic-visualiser/sonic-visualiser), but with an added panel displaying musical scores, and additional features such as audio-to-score alignment. The program needs to be used together with the [aligner plugin] (https://github.com/yucongj/SV_PianoAligner).
