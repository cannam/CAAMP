CAAMP: Computer-assisted Annotation and Analysis of Music Performance
================

### *Performance Precision* is a software application that assists analyzing recorded piano performances together with their scores.

*Performance Precision* is adapted from [*Sonic Visualiser*](https://github.com/sonic-visualiser/sonic-visualiser), but with an added panel displaying musical scores, and additional features such as audio-to-score alignment. The program needs to be used together with Vamp aligner plugins that can conduct audio-to-score alignment. Existing Vamp aligner plugins include [aligner plugin](https://github.com/yucongj/piano-aligner).
